Getting and Cleaning Data Course

_Assignment 1_
==============



This repo contains code and description of the procedure to produce a summary
dataset out of the measurements made by recording human activity using
smartphones.

A broader description of the source data and the products can be found in the
`CodeBook.md` file.

The procedure is coded in the file `run_analysis.R` which can be executed by the
R interpreter. This code asumes the existence of a directory with the name `UCI
HAR Dataset` in the same directory.
